pizza
=====

I've finally reached a point in my life where I'm relatively satisfied with the pizza I make, so I am sharing my recipe. It's nothing special. Feel free to fork it (har har) and make it your own. Pizza is one of those things that you can make a million times and each time is slightly different. 

I'm certainly no expert, but after ten years of making pizzas, here's what I've learned:

* FLOUR
* HEAT

Don't use all-purpose flour. Sure, you can if you want, but you'll be fighting an uphill battle. Use [Tipo 00](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O8HWEG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You can order it on Amazon or maybe find it in an Italian specialty store.

### Ingredients

* 1 packet yeast
* 1 cup warm water
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* ~1 tablespoon salt
* ~2-3 cups Tipo 00 flour

### Steps

* Put water and yeast in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the sugar so the yeast has something to eat and can then poop out awesomeness.
* Stir that shiz and give the yeast some time and privacy for pooping.
* After 5-10 minutes, you will notice the yeast poop.
* Stir it up (bob marley) and start slowly adding in the flour and salt.
I find that I need 2-3 cups flour per cup of water. It's not an exact science, it's a labor of love. Feel free to rub the dough on your body. The dough should be stretchy, not too wet, not too dry.
* If you're going to err, err on the "too wet" side, because you can always add more flour when rolling.
* Now that your dough is "fleshy," oil a small bowl and stick it in there to rise. I usually cover it with a dish towel for "yeast privacy."
* Let the yeast poop for another hour or so.
* After an hour, punch the dough down and knead for a few minutes.
 * Form a ball and roll it out like a boss!
* Add a thin layer of sauce [Don Pepino](http://www.donpepino.com/) and your cheese and (optional) toppings.
* Crank your oven up as high (probably 550) as it will go and cook for 7-9 minutes.
* Stuff your face HARD!!!!!
