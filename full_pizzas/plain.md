## Ingredients

Use the following pizza components:

* dough/plain.md
* cheese/mozzarella.md
* sauce/pizza_sauce.md

## Process

* Pre-heat your oven as high as it will go, mine tops out at 550 Fahrenheit.
* Lightly oil a pizza pan or prepare your pizza stone.
* Roll out the dough into a roughly 14" circle and transfer it to the pan.
* Take about 1/2 cup of sauce and use a spoon to spread it onto the dough. Don't use too much sauce or your cheese/toppings will slide.
* Use about 3/4 cups of cheese and spread it over the sauce.
* Place the pan in the oven for approximately 8 minutes.
* Remove the pizza from the oven, let cool for a minute or so, and then slice it up.
