**Ingredients**

1kg (2.2lbs) Tipo "00" flour

15 grams of salt

1 packet (7grams) of active dry yeast

1 tsp sugar

625 grams of warm (not hot) water

**Steps**

* Place the water and yeast in a bowl. Sprinkle the sugar in and stir to activate the yeast. Wait ~10 minutes.
* Stir the yeast/water mix. Slowly add the flour. If you have a Kitchenaid mixer or something like it, mix on the lowest setting for 4 minutes.
* Stop mixing, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
* After the 20 minutes is up, mix again for about a minute.
* Lightly oil a large bowl, and transfer the dough to the oiled bowl.
* Let it rise for at least 1 hour.
* Lightly flour the top of the dough and punch it out.
* Divide dough into (2 or) 3 equal-weight balls.
* Place the dough balls into lightly-oiled Ziplock bags and freeze or refrigerate them for 24-48 hours.
* Let one of the dough balls rise at room temperature and roll it out or hand-stretch it into a 14" circle.
