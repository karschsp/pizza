My favorite pizza sauce is Don Pepino, which, luckily, is easy to find where I live (Northeast US).

It can also be ordered on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=don%20pepino%20pizza%20sauce&sprefix=don+pepino%2Caps%2C220&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Adon%20pepino%20pizza%20sauce

* Take about 1/3 of the can (5oz) and use a spoon to spread it over the pizza in a circular motion.
* The amount you use depends on the thickness of your dough. If you're going for a thin-crust pizza, go light on the sauce. Thicker doughs can handle more sauce.
